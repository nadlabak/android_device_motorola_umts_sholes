         prevent the IccNetworkDepersonalizationPanel from being shown,

    <!-- Flag indicating whether the Phone app should provide
         a "Dismiss" button on the SIM network unlock screen.
         The default value is true.
         If set to false, there will be *no way* to dismiss the SIM
         network unlock screen if you don't enter the correct unlock code.
         (One important consequence: there will be no way to make an
         Emergency Call if your SIM is network-locked and you don't know
         the PIN.) -->

    <!-- If true, enable the onscreen touch UI for incoming calls.
         This feature is necessary for devices with no hard SEND/END keys,

    <!-- If true, enable the onscreen touch UI for regular "ongoing call"
         states of the in-call UI.
         In general, the touch UI is used for regular calls only on
         devices with a proximity sensor.  (On other devices, we can't
         have touchable UI onscreen during a call because of the risk of
         false cheek touches.)
         TODO: maybe this can be determined algorithmically based on
         specific properties of the device, perhaps by detecting the
         presence of a proximity sensor and/or hard SEND/END keys.  (If
         so, we wouldn't need this flag at all.) -->

    <!-- While an incoming call is ringing, this flag specifies whether
         the BACK key should reject the current call (just like the
         ENDCALL button does.)
         This was originally the default behavior for all platforms, but
         it's a bad idea on devices where the BACK key is a capacitive
         button (since it's too easy to press the key accidentally as you
         pull the phone out of your pocket.)  So devices that *don't* want
         this behavior should set this flag to false via the resource
         overlay.  -->

         In practice this is used on all platforms even the ones with hard SEND/END
         keys, but for maximum flexibility it's controlled by a flag here
         (which can be overridden on a per-product basis.) -->
